# CTG Data Analysis

This repository contains my project for the course "Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning in Healthcare" in my MSc. The project focuses on the analysis of Cardiotocography (CTG) data using machine learning algorithms, including supervised learning and neural network models.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of the project include:

- Data Visualization: Utilizing the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to visualize the CTG data. Visualizations are used to gain a better understanding of the data and identify any patterns or trends.

- Supervised Learning: Implementation of various supervised learning algorithms to classify the CTG data. These algorithms include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN).

- Neural Network Models: Implementation of neural network models to perform classification tasks on the CTG data. The TensorFlow software library is used to build and train neural networks. The models may include simple feedforward networks or more advanced architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) or recurrent neural networks (RNN).
